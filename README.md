# DeepFaceAuthentication
DeepFaceAuthentication is a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system that enhances security by using facial recognition as an additional layer of authentication. It leverages machine learning, computer vision, and liveness detection to ensure that only legitimate users can gain access, preventing spoofing attacks from photos or videos.
